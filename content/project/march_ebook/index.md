In this issue exploring mechanisms behind cancer cell immune evasion I contributed 2 science news article.

&nbsp;
## An Orchestrated Attack Helps Cancer Cells Evade Immune Defenses ##

Using CRISPR-Cas9 screening methods, scientists identified a core set of genes that boost cancer cell resistance to killer T cells

Reference: K.A. Lawson et al., “Functional genomic landscape of cancer-intrinsic evasion of killing by T cells,” _Nature_.

&nbsp;
## Tracing the Steps of Tumor Development ##

Single-cell sequencing methods help scientists characterize the cellular heterogeneity in solid tumors and reconstruct the trajectory of tumor progression.

Reference: S.D. Praktiknjo et al., “Tracing tumorigenesis in a solid tumor model at single-cell resolution,” _Nature Communications_.
