In this issue, I contributed 4 short science news stories that explore how microbes shape health, disease, and the world beyond.

&nbsp;
## Gut Microbes Alter the Health Benefits of a Mediterranean Diet

Longitudinal dietary habits and stool samples help scientists understand how the gut microbiome determines whether an individual fully benefits from a heart healthy diet.

Reference:
D.D. Wang et al., “The gut microbiome modulates the protective association between
a Mediterranean diet and cardiometabolic disease risk,” _Nat Med_, 27:333-43, 2021.

&nbsp;
## Increased Rates of Gene Transfer in Industrialized Microbes

From urban metropolises to pastoral communities, the world around us shapes the function of our microbiome through frequent horizontal gene transfer.

Reference:
M. Groussin et al., “Elevated rates of horizontal gene transfer in the industrial- ized human microbiome,” _Cell_, 184(8): 2053-67, 2021.

&nbsp;
## Searching the Seas for New Antifungals

The sea squirt microbiome helps researchers combat the growing problem of drug-resistant fungi.

Reference:
F. Zhang et al., “A marine microbiome anti- fungal targets urgent-threat drug-resistant fungi,” _Science_, 370(6519):974-78, 2020.

&nbsp;
## Legume Trees Hold the Microbial Key to Unlock Essential Soil Nutrients

Nitrogen-fixing trees and their soil microbiomes play an important role in fertilizing the tropical forest community.

Reference:
D.Z. Epihov et al., “Legume-microbiome interactions unlock mineral nutrients
in regrowing tropical forests,” _PNAS_, 118(11):e2022241118, 2021.
