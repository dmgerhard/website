In this issue, I contributed 4 short science news stories on checkpoint inhibitors.

&nbsp;
## Fecal Transplants Could Help Combat Checkpoint Inhibitor Resistance ##

In two different Phase I trials, researchers demonstrated the safety of fecal microbiota transplant and provided evidence that it improves treatment response in a subset of melanoma patients.

&nbsp;
## Predicting Immunotherapy Response from Tumor Gene Expression ##

Using pan-cancer whole-exome and transcriptome data and multivariate predictive models, researchers identified biomarkers associated with sensitivity to checkpoint inhibitors.

&nbsp;
## A Targeted Delivery System for Checkpoint Inhibitors Improves Efficacy ##

New research shows how encapsulating checkpoint inhibitors in metal-organic frameworks can lead to a more targeted and sustained delivery to the tumor microenvironment.

&nbsp;
## A Simple and Cost-Effective Pan-Cancer Biomarker ##

In a retrospective study of cancer patients on checkpoint inhibitors, researchers showed how a biomarker obtained from a routine blood test may predict sensitivity to checkpoint inhibitor treatment.
