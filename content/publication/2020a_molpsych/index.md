abstract: The SHANK3 gene encodes a postsynaptic scaffold protein in excitatory synapses, and its disruption is implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders such as Phelanâ€“McDermid syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. Most studies of SHANK3 in the neocortex and hippocampus have focused on disturbances in pyramidal neurons. However, GABAergic interneurons likewise receive excitatory inputs and presumably would also be a target of constitutive SHANK3 perturbations. In this study, we characterize the prefrontal cortical microcircuit in awake mice using subcellular-resolution two-photon microscopy. We focused on a nonsense R1117X mutation, which leads to truncated SHANK3 and has been linked previously to cortical dysfunction. We find that R1117X mutants have abnormally elevated calcium transients in apical dendritic spines. The synaptic calcium dysregulation is due to a loss of dendritic inhibition via decreased NMDAR currents and reduced firing of dendrite-targeting somatostatin-expressing (SST) GABAergic interneurons. Notably, upregulation of the NMDAR subunit GluN2B in SST interneurons corrects the excessive synaptic calcium signals and ameliorates learning deficits in R1117X mutants. These findings reveal dendrite-targeting interneurons, and more broadly the inhibitory control of dendritic spines, as a key microcircuit mechanism compromised by the SHANK3 dysfunction.
