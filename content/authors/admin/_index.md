I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate of Neuroscience in Psychiatry in the lab of Dr. Francis Lee.

My research examines the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying stress, anxiety, and depression with a focus on adolescent development. As part of this work I examine the enduring effects of pre-adolescent stress on the maturation of neural circuits important for sociability and emotion regulation. I also study fear regulation across adolescence and adulthood.

I received my PhD in 2017 from Yale University where I worked in the lab of Dr. Ronald Duman. My thesis research examined the mechanisms of action of the rapid-acting antidepressant ketamine.

In addition to academic research, I am a freelance science writer.
