I joined *The Scientist* as an Assistant Editor in 2023, where I write about discoveries in the life sciences.

Before joining the magazine, I was a a Postdoctoral Research Associate of Neuroscience in Psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medicine. I was also a freelance science writer and I contributed stories to *Drug Discovery News* and *The Scientist*.

You can find my recent articles in the Science Communication section below.
